                                The first 2 days of the camp are spent learning how the camp runs: we provide safety

                                Camps' activities. Late arrivals miss out on these fundamental sessions and we have
                                found that this affects the experience of the Camp. Those leaving early will miss out on
                                the closing events, and affect their team balance

                                        Accommodation in Daglio is spartan (dorms, not so hot water etc.). The real joy

                                    <strong>This is the third item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by
                                    default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to
                                    style each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the
                                    showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom
                                    CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about
                                    any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition
                                    does limit overflow.
